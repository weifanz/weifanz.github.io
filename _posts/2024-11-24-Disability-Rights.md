<p>Despite some of my posts making sarcastic remarks about US politics, one thing I appreciate about the United States is its disability rights. This is something I observed in class.</p> 

<p>On a normal Tuesday in class, one of the students suddenly went into convulsions and lost consciousness. It was a seizure. People around were shocked, but they calmed down and took action immediately.</p> 

<p>They tried to keep the student on the chair to prevent injury, but this time the seizure was too strong, and she started to fall off the chair. Some students tried to hold her, while others called campus safety or rushed to the science building office for help. All the students around her moved desks and chairs away to prevent her head from being injured further, and they placed clothes under her head. Several minutes later, campus safety and the science building staff arrived. They waited for the student to regain consciousness and asked several questions to assess the severity of the seizure. People waited patiently in class. Even though it took around 20 minutes and the class was paused, the student's health and safety were considered far more important.</p> 

<p>This had happened several times before, but other students had gained experience with the scenario and responded in a calm, professional manner. Fortunately, the student is able to receive an education like everyone else, and the college staff are well-prepared to handle sudden situations effectively.</p>

<p>For any disability cases around us, it is worth knowing how to provide help in a professional way.</p>
