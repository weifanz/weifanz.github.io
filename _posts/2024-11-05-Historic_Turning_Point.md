<p>I am an international student who cannot vote. The only reason I wrote this article is that I feel today is a turning point in history, and I hope it might be helpful for any historians 1,000 years from now. (Well, I’m just joking.)</p> 

<p>We know November 5 is the voting date in the United States. Previously, the only way I observed the vote was through television or the internet because I wasn’t in the United States four years ago. Observing the voting day on campus for the first time was more engaging than I expected.</p> 

<p>In the morning, the violinist I accompany contacted me to reschedule our rehearsal because they needed to find time to vote. I agreed. Then, when I opened social media, I saw many friends posting messages encouraging people to vote. They were spreading information about how to vote and emphasizing the importance of voting rights. I’m not sure what it was like in previous years, but I can see strong participation from U.S. Gen Z in the 2024 presidential election.</p> 

<p>This year, I’ve noticed many changes, such as Joseph Biden stepping down, attacks on Trump, the involvement of social media and tech companies, concerns about potential conflicts after this year’s election, the ongoing and potential wars, and the increasing polarization of ideologies. Diversity and localization seem to be clashing in significant ways.</p> 

<p>I believe that no matter who is elected, this election is a historic turning point. People want to "correct" the course of history, but they are still part of a larger historical trend.</p> 

<p>Especially under a society that is not quite transparent.</p>
